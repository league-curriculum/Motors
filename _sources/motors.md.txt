# Continuous DC Motors

One of the most common types of motors is the continuous rotation DC motor. These motors use the magnetic field created when electricity moves through a wire to push against a permanent magnet. Motors come in a tange of sizes, from microscopically tiny to enormous, but we will be using a common type of low voltage motors that is small, simple and inexpensive:
