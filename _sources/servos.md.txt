A hobby servo is built from a regular brushed motor,  gear train, a position
sensor, and som internal circuitry. It will only move back and forth 180
degrees; it cant turn around continuously. This makes them useful for moving
joints on a robot arm or flaps on an airplane, but not for wheels on a car.
They are very inexpensive and easy to use, so they are common in hobby
projects. While there are some industrial versions, their inaccuracy makes them
rare in commercial products.
