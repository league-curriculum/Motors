# Setup Microbit

First, let's get our Microbit setup and ensure that we can program it. Start
with your computer, the short USB cable, and your microbit.

Then, plug in the microbit to your computer:

Then, **using the Chrome or Chromium browser**, visit the Micro:bit MakeCode project website:  
<a href="https://makecode.microbit.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://makecode.microbit.org</a>

First, click on the <img class="inline" src="https://images.jointheleague.org/microbit/sign_in.png"> 
button in the upper-right to create an account. 

To Load your first program, click on the Import button, which looks like this:

In the import window, click on the middle box, "Import URL...."

Then, enter this URL:

```
https://github.com/League-Microbit/flashing-heart
```

You should see the Micro:bit editor screen, with a very simple program.

```{admonition} Chrome Browser Recommended
:class: warning
For the next step, downloading, you should be running the Chrome browser,
although  Firefox or Edge might also work. But Chrome is best supported. 
If you have a Chromebook, you are running Chrome
```

Now, click on the purple "Download" button at the bottom of the screen, and follow the instructions for downloading the program to your Micro:bit. 

You should now see a flashing heart on your Micro:bit:

Congratulations! You have created your first Micro:bit program.

```{admonition} Easter Eggs
:class: tip
Before you leave, read the Micro:bit program and see if there is anything else the program does
besides flash a heart.
