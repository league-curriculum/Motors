# Connecting Power

When you are connecting circuits together, you will need to not only need to
connect the signals, you will also have to supply power for running the circuit.
Some circuits, such as the Micro:bit, get their power from the USB connection,
but other circuits will need to be connected to a power line.

There are several types of connects we will have to ensure that we have: 

* Positive power. This is often marked with a "+" or "Vcc" and the color is
  usually red. ( However, in this kit, our power supply wire is white. ) 

* Negative Power. This wire is often marked with a "-" and the color is usually
  black. It is often connected to ground. 

* Ground. Ground is a neutral wire, it always has 0 volts. It will be labeled
"G" or "Gnd" and it's color is green.  It is often connected to the power supply
negative. 

For the types of circuits we will work on, the negative is always connected to
ground. Because the ground and negative are always connected, the color for
these connections are black, not green/


BTW, the ground connection is called "ground" because it is literally connected
to a stake in the ground. The ground line of our circuits are connected to the
ground wire of the building's electrical connection. ( If an  electrical wall
socket looks like a face, the ground connection is the mouth.  ) The building
ground wire will go to the electrical panel of the building, where it will be
connected to either a long copper spike that is driven into the ground, or to a
copper water pipe that is in the ground.
