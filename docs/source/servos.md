# Hobby Servos

A hobby servo is build from a regular brushed motor,  gear train, a position sensor, 
and som internal circuitry. It will only move up to 180 degrees, but they
are very inexpensive and easy to use, so they are common in hobby projects. WHile there are
some industrial versions, their inaccuracy makes them rare in commercial products.
